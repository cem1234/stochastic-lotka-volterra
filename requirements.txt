#
# Requirements for the Stochastic Reaction–Diffusion Lotka–Volterra code
# when running on Google Colab Pro+.
# 
# Note:
#  1) Colab already includes some version of jax/jaxlib. Often, you'll upgrade
#     to a specific CUDA-compatible wheel for best GPU performance.
#  2) For CPU-only usage, installing "jax" and "jaxlib" directly can suffice.
#  3) If you need exact reproducibility, pin versions (e.g., jax==0.4.10).

jax>=0.4.10
jaxlib>=0.4.10
diffrax>=0.2.4
